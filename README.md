# Task 1 : Perform Data Cleaning

For the first task, I performed data cleaning on both training and test sets of the Titanic dataset. The cleaning process involved removing missing values and outliers from the dataset. Missing values and outliers can significantly impact the accuracy and reliability of data analysis and modeling. To identify outliers, I utilized visualization techniques such as box plots, count plots and employed statistical methods like Interquartile Range (IQR) method. By thoroughly cleaning the dataset, I ensured that the subsequent analysis and modeling would be based on a more accurate, reliable and robust data, thus improving the overall quality of insights derived from the datasets.

# Task 2 : Calculate Summary Statistics

For the second task, I calculated summary statistics for both the training and test sets of the Titanic dataset. Summary statistics, including measures such as mean, median, mode, min, max, range, variance and standard deviation provide valuable insights into the central tendency and variability of the dataset. These statistics help in understanding the distribution of data and identifying any anomalies or patterns present within it. By calculating summary statistics, I gained a deeper understanding of the Titanic dataset, which informed subsequent analysis and decision-making processes.

# Task 3 : Visualization using Histogram

Lastly, for the third task, I created visualizations using histograms on the Iris dataset. Histograms are a powerful tool for visualizing the distribution of numerical data. By plotting histograms for the Iris dataset, i was able to analyse patterns and trends in the data, such as the distribution of Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width across different species of iris flowers. These visualizations facilitated effective data exploration and interpretation, allowing for the extraction of valuable insights from the dataset.
